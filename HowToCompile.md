This little guide will help you to compile everything that is included in this pack. Let us start simple:

# Dependencies

- Install DevkitPro with Switch support
- Install needed packages:
    - **Linux:** ```sudo dkp-pacman -S devkitA64 switch-tools switch-curl switch-bzip2 switch-curl switch-freetype switch-libjpeg-turbo switch-sdl2 switch-sdl2_gfx switch-sdl2_image switch-sdl2_ttf switch-zlib switch-libpng```
    - **Windows** ```pacman -S devkitA64 switch-tools switch-curl switch-bzip2 switch-curl switch-freetype switch-libjpeg-turbo switch-sdl2 switch-sdl2_gfx switch-sdl2_image switch-sdl2_ttf switch-zlib switch-libpng```
        - You may have to run this command through Msys2 if it doesn't work
- A clean clone of the repo
    - For that simply ```git clone https://github.com/tumGER/SDFilesSwitch.git``` to your desired location
        - There are some weird issues on Windows if you have spaces somewhere in the path to your location so make sure to clone it somewhere where the Path doesn't include spaces
- [LibNX](https://github.com/tumGER/SDFilesSwitch/blob/master/HowToCompile.md#libnx) 

# Updating Dependencies

1. Open / Cd your console to the folder you cloned the repo to
2. Type ```git submodule update --remote --force``` to update the submodules
3. Success, the submodules should now be updated to the latest commit of their origin

Please repeat

# LibNX

**Make sure to [Update Dependencies](https://github.com/tumGER/SDFilesSwitch/blob/master/HowToCompile.md#updating-dependencies) before before updating LibNX**

1. Go into the LibNX submodule folder
2. Type ```make```
3. Wait till it finished compiling
4. Type ```make install```


# Updating Atmosphere's Loader, SM and LayeredFS with Patches

**Atmosphere sometimes even uses features that aren't even in LibNX yet, in that case follow the previous steps but use the [Atmosphere LibNX fork](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/libnx/tree/for-atmosphere) by typing ```git clone https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/libnx.git -b for-atmosphere``` into your desired location**

**Make sure to [Update Dependencies](https://github.com/tumGER/SDFilesSwitch/blob/master/HowToCompile.md#updating-dependencies) before before compiling Atmosphere**

**Make sure to [Update LibNX](https://github.com/tumGER/SDFilesSwitch/blob/master/HowToCompile.md#libnx) before before compiling Atmosphere**

Atmosphere needs some custom changes to it to work with current hekate and also to compile. While we don't need to compile Atmosphere completely, we will in this tutorial because it's easier and breaks much less (in my experience)

1. Go into "Atmosphere\fusee\fusee-primary\src" and find "main.c"
2. Type ```#define I_KNOW_WHAT_I_AM_DOING``` into line 14 (or similar)
    - This is needed to make it actually compile - It's basically a small warning that will hopefully be removed some day
3. Go into "Atmosphere\stratosphere\loader\source" and find "ldr_main.cpp"
4. Remove
    ```cpp 
        /* Check for exosphere API compatibility. */
        u64 exosphere_cfg;
        if (R_FAILED(splGetConfig((SplConfigItem)65000, &exosphere_cfg))) {
            //fatalSimple(0xCAFE << 4 | 0xFF);
            /* TODO: Does Loader need to know about target firmware/master key revision? If so, extract from exosphere_cfg. */
        }
    ```
located ~ at line 72
    - This removes the Exosphere API Check from the Loader
    
5. Go into "Atmosphere\stratosphere\fs_mitm" and find "fsmitm_main.cpp"
6. Remove
```cpp
    /* Check for exosphere API compatibility. */
    u64 exosphere_cfg;
    if (R_SUCCEEDED(splGetConfig((SplConfigItem)65000, &exosphere_cfg))) {
        /* MitM requires Atmosphere API 0.1. */
        u16 api_version = (exosphere_cfg >> 16) & 0xFFFF;
        if (api_version < 0x0001) {
            fatalSimple(0xCAFE << 4 | 0xFE);
        }
    } else {
        fatalSimple(0xCAFE << 4 | 0xFF);
    }
```
located ~ at line 67

7. Go back into the root of the Atmosphere submodule
8. Type "make"
9. Wait a bit, this will take some time
10. Go back into "Atmosphere\stratosphere\fs_mitm"
11. Type "make"
12. Wait a bit, this will take some time
13. Copy "loader.kip" from "Atmosphere\stratosphere\loader" into:
    - "SDFilesSwitch/Compiled/modules/newfirm/"
14. Copy "fs_mitm.kip" from "Atmosphere\stratosphere\fs_mitm" into:    
    - "SDFilesSwitch/Compiled/modules/newfirm/"
15. Copy "sm.kip" from "Atmosphere\stratosphere\sm" into:
    - "SDFilesSwitch/Compiled/modules/newfirm/"
16. Copy the updated files to your SD and test them on your Switch
    - If everything worked, congrats! You compiled Atmosphere's patched Loader, SM and LayeredFS :)
    - If it didn't, you either messed something up or Atmosphere had some change to its code in the time I wrote this till now - In that case I'd guess contacting me over Twitter (@_tomGER [Or @tumGER since I check that more often]) is your best bet if I'm gone - If you're here because you just wanted to compile it yourself than contact me over tomGER

3. Type make on the root of the Atmosphere submodule
4. Copy "sm.kip" from "Atmosphere\stratosphere\sm", "fs_mitm.kip" from "Atmosphere\stratosphere\fs_mitm", "loader.kip" from "Atmosphere\stratosphere\loader" and "exosphere.bin" from "Atmosphere/exosphere" into "Compiled/modules/atmosphere"

# Updating other submodules

**Make sure to [Update Dependencies](https://github.com/tumGER/SDFilesSwitch/blob/master/HowToCompile.md#updating-dependencies) before before compiling submodules**

**Make sure to [Update LibNX](https://github.com/tumGER/SDFilesSwitch/blob/master/HowToCompile.md#libnx) before before updating before compiling submodules**

Here comes the easy part :) Updating all other submodules is really really easy and all follow nearly the same steps:

1. Go into each submodule folder
2. Type "make"
    - You need to type "make nx" for **hbmenu**
3. It should now have compiled it - The location is often pretty easy to find:
    - You'll get a .nro for EdiZon, AppstoreNX, GagOrder, SDFilesUpdater and hbmenu
    - You'll get a .kip from dreport
4. Replace the old one in the compiled folder

**Gag Order Icon:**

1. Start [NRO Asset Editor](https://github.com/vgmoose/nro-asset-editor/releases)
2. Choose your newly compiled Gag Order build
3. Choose the icon to be the one located at "SDFilesSwitch\resources\icons" called GagOrder.png

![The Icon](/Resources/Icons/GagOrder.png)

4. Save you changes
5. Replace the old one in the compiled folder

# Hekate Bootlogo

![By @jpe230](/Resources/Bootimages/Splash-jpe230.png)

- Start your photo editor of choice (I use GIMP because I'm poor and actually kinda like GIMP)
A. Open one of the three .xcf files and change the version number to the number of the release you want to make
B. Create your own one

1. Create a new 720 x 1280 canvas
    - Make sure you picture is roated 90Â° counterclockwise
2. Use your graphic design passion
    - If you want to update the repo, make sure to include Credits, a link to the Repo, version number and all the other stuff you also see on my splash screens 
3. Export it as a .png
4. Use some online converter to convert the .png to a .bmp
    - We need to use a online converter because GIMP currently has some issues with it
5. Call it bootlogo.bmp if you want to use it as the standard one
    - You can also choose a specific bootlogo for each launch option by writting ```logopath=LinkToBootimage.bmp``` into your hekate-ipl.ini ([Example](https://github.com/tumGER/SDFilesSwitch/blob/8653108d41096f60c43f5dab56b41024fa785c5d/Compiled/hekate_ipl.ini#L60))
5. Put it on the root of your SD / root of "SDFilesSwitch/Compiled"
